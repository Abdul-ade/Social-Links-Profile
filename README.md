## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<figure>
  <img src="assets/images/avatar-jessica.jpeg" alt="Photo of Jessica" />
  <figcaption>
    <h1>Jessica Randall</h1>
    <h2>London, United Kingdom</h2>
    <p>"Front-end developer and avid reader."</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Continued development

I am happy I finished another project. I really just want to refine my frontend skills using the basics. I learned here that no matter how easy a project looks, you always have one thing to learn from it. I plan to keep doing these projects with Html, CSS and JS if necessary.
